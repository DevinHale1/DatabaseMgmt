# DatabaseMgmt
Database management work(AIST 3410) 
This was a final group project in which we were required to find a real business and create a database in SQL based on their business needs.
We created a relational ER model to show the relationships between objects
We created a database with SQL and created commands to insert tables and information into those tables (as if we were contracted by the company to create a database for them.)
After our project was completed, we presented it before the class and described our methodologies.
